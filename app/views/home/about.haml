          About
        %p
          Oil Reporter is a pretty simple idea. We want people to share what they see and to allow that information to be shared with everyone. We believe that if people share what they see and that information can be placed on a map, it can help organizations and communities with their response efforts.

          Oil Reporter is available

          Oil Reporter’s Adopt-A-Beach initiative will provide the opportunity for virtual volunteers to review high resolutions imagery of the Gulf Coast and to map data elements such as perimeters of oil presence and injured wildlife in remote areas where physical assessment access is limited. This also provides an opportunity for Oil Reporter photographs and video to be joined with high resolution imagery to provide greater understanding and provide an ability to share data from these sources back to the public.

          Oil Reporter data is open and available to anyone via its 
          %a{ :href => "api", "gt-evt" => "click", "gt-cat" => "api" }
            open API. 
          Response organizations may need assistance in turning that data into products, placing information on maps. Dr. Eric Frost and the team San Diego State University’s Visualization Center will be the data repository for Oil Reporter and will be leading a team of academic partners to provide technical assistance and products to response organizations by request.
