            Oil Reporter was built by 
            = link_to 'Intridea', 'http://intridea.com'
            for the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill.  On April 20, 2010, an explosion occurred on the semi-submersible offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico killing 11 rig workers and injuring 17 others.  On April 24, it was found that the wellhead was damaged and was leaking oil into the Gulf.  Oil Reporter enables people to help with the recovery effort by using real-time check-ins to report what they're seeing on the ground.  Users can upload photos and videos, reporting oil sighting, harmed wildlife sightings and much more.
